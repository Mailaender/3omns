SYNOPSIS
--------
*3omns* ['OPTIONS...']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
3omns is an old-school arcade-style tile-based bomb-dropping deathmatch game.
The name is a bastardization of the word Bombs (and you should pronounce it
however you want).

The red player uses the arrow keys to move and R-Ctrl to drop bombs.  The blue
player uses WASD to move and L-Ctrl to drop bombs.  Damage players (and destroy
crates) by catching them in a bomb blast or ``punching'' them by walking into
them.  You can disarm opponent bombs by walking over them.  A few crates
contain powerups that briefly make you invulnerable.

3omns supports play over a network using the *--serve* or *--connect* options
(see <<net-options,Network Play Options>> below).

OPTIONS
-------
*-g*, *--game*='MOD'::
    Normally, 3omns looks for game logic Lua code in *'RES'/base*.  Specify an
    alternative to *base* in 'MOD' to run different game logic (a mod, if you
    will).  The mod must provide the file *'RES'/'MOD'/init.lua*.

////
TODO: figure out how to coerce autoconf into letting us use @pkgdatadir@ or
something similar below, instead of referring the user to
'--default-resources'.  See the autoconf manual section 4.8.2
"Installation Directory Variables".
////

*-r*, *--resources*='RES'::
    Normally, 3omns looks for its resources somewhere like */usr/share/3omns*
    (see *3omns --default-resources* for the actual location).  Specify an
    alternative in 'RES'.

[[net-options]]
=== Network Play Options
*-c*, *--connect*='SERVER'::
    Run as a client and connect to the hosting 'SERVER'.

*-p*, *--port*='PORT'::
    Port to use when serving or connecting.  Unless specified, 3omns uses port
    30325 (which looks kind of like 3OMNS if you tilt your head).

*-s*, *--serve*[='LISTEN']::
    Run as a host and listen on the given 'LISTEN' address.  If not specified,
    'LISTEN' defaults to the wildcard address.

=== Debug Options
*-d*, *--debug*::
    Some useful diagnostic information is printed as 3omns runs, and if a Lua
    error is encountered, you are dropped into a Lua debug session.  You can
    also enter a Lua debug session at any time by pressing the *`* (grave
    accent/tilde) key.

*-n*, *--debug-network*::
    Print all network communication as it happens.

=== Informational Options
*-R*, *--default-resources*::
    Print the default value of 'RES', the path where 3omns normally looks for
    its resources, and exit.  This just provides an unambiguous way to find
    the path without parsing the help text.

*-?*, *--help*::
    Print a brief command line help listing and exit.

*--usage*::
    Print a terse command line usage summary and exit.

*-V*, *--version*::
    Print 3omns version and exit.

BUGS
----
3omns is still in alpha.  These are some of the major deficiencies in the
current version:

* Limited to 2 human players and 2 bots
* Bot AI isn't very good
* In network play, all connected computers can control both human players
* Sometimes in network play clients won't see bomb explosions
