Building and Installing 3omns
=============================

If you've cloned 3omns in git or downloaded a source tarball, use autoreconf to
kick off the build process:

    autoreconf -i

3omns uses the standard Autotools build sequence:

    ./configure
    make

See './configure --help' for build options.

Once 3omns is built, you can run it directly out of the build directory without
installing:

    ./3omns

To install, run something like:

    sudo make install
