Building and Installing 3omns
=============================

If you happen to be running Ubuntu Xenial or Trusty and just want to see the
latest release of 3omns in action, you can skip building it yourself and
install it from the 3omns PPA (see
https://launchpad.net/~chazomaticus/+archive/3omns):

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chazomaticus/3omns
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install 3omns

If you want the latest from git or aren't running Xenial or Trusty, you can
build and optionally install 3omns from source by following these instructions.


Dependencies
------------

3omns is (partly) written in C11, so it requires a fairly modern C compiler.

3omns depends on the following libraries:

  * SDL 2.0 (http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
  * SDL_image 2.0 (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
  * SDL_ttf 2.0 (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)
  * Lua 5.3 (http://www.lua.org/download.html)

On Ubuntu Xenial, you can install the development versions of these libraries
by running:

    sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev \
            liblua5.3-dev

3omns also depends on GNU glibc's argp library
(https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argp.html).  In Linux, argp
normally comes with your build system, but non-GNU systems may have to install
a standalone version and tell 3omns's build files where to find it.

The 3omns build process optionally depends on AsciiDoc (http://asciidoc.org/)
to generate the manpage.  AsciiDoc may also depend on some 3rd party tools to
function properly.  In Ubuntu Xenial, you can install the correct dependencies
by running:

    sudo apt install asciidoc libxml2-utils xsltproc docbook-xml docbook-xsl


Build
-----

If you've cloned 3omns in git, use autoreconf to kick off the build process:

    autoreconf -i

3omns uses the standard Autotools build sequence:

    ./configure
    make

See './configure --help' for build options.

Once 3omns is built, you can run it directly out of the build directory without
installing:

    ./3omns


Install
-------

If you decide you want to install it, run something like:

    sudo make install
