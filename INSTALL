Building and Installing 3omns
=============================

If you happen to be running Ubuntu Trusty and just want to see the latest
release of 3omns in action, you can skip building it yourself and install it
from the 3omns PPA (see https://launchpad.net/~chazomaticus/+archive/3omns):

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chazomaticus/3omns
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install 3omns

If you want the latest from git or aren't running Trusty, you can build and
optionally install 3omns from source by following these instructions.


Dependencies
------------

First, you should install some dependencies.  3omns depends on the following
libraries:

  * SDL 2.0 (http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
  * SDL_image 2.0 (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
  * SDL_ttf 2.0 (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)
  * Lua 5.2 (http://www.lua.org/download.html)

On Ubuntu Trusty, you can install the development versions of these libraries
by running:

    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev \
            liblua5.2-dev

I should also mention that 3omns depends on GNU glibc's argp library
(https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argp.html).  In Linux, argp
normally comes with your build system, but non-GNU systems may have to install
a standalone version and tell 3omns's build files where to find it.


Build
-----

If you've cloned 3omns in git or downloaded a source tarball, use autoreconf to
kick off the build process:

    autoreconf -i

3omns uses the standard Autotools build sequence:

    ./configure
    make

See './configure --help' for build options.


Install
-------

Once 3omns is built, you can run it directly out of the build directory without
installing:

    ./3omns

If you decide you want to install it, run something like:

    sudo make install
