3omns
=====

3omns is an old-school arcade-style tile-based bomb-dropping deathmatch game.
The name is a bastardization of the word Bombs (and you should pronounce it
however you want).  The 3omns engine is written in C, using SDL2 for
platform-agnostic rendering.  The game logic is implemented in Lua.

3omns is currently in alpha.

Features
--------

* 2-player deathmatch
* Bot AI
* Same-keyboard or LAN play

How to Play
-----------

See the INSTALL file for building and installation instructions.  If you're
running Ubuntu Trusty, you can skip building from source and simply add the
3omns PPA; see <https://launchpad.net/~chazomaticus/+archive/3omns>.

Once 3omns is installed, run `3omns` to play.  See also `3omns --help` for
options, including how to play over the LAN.

The red player uses the arrow keys to move and R-Ctrl to drop bombs.  The blue
player uses WASD to move and L-Ctrl to drop bombs.  Damage players (and destroy
crates) by catching them in a bomb blast or "punching" them by walking into
them.  You can disarm opponent bombs by walking over them.  A few crates
contain powerups that briefly make you invulnerable.

Bugs of Note
------------

* Limited to 2 human players and 2 bots
* Bot AI isn't very good
* In LAN play, all connected computers can control both human players
* Net play is entirely unreliable outside of the LAN
* Sometimes in LAN play clients won't see bomb explosions


Enjoy!
